       "'You know, I think about everyone who’s ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on the stage tonight, Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard. Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this President’s criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the F.B.I., tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation. Then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal. If you do not hold them to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our constitution and our country, we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line and we cannot do that. I’ve met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there, what they want is a shot. They want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage. If we compliment that with investment in world-class pre K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than five million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot. They don’t want a handout, they don’t want a job guarantee. They just want a shot, and as president, I will give them that shot. I think it’s part of the solution, but I think we need to be focused on lifting people up, and sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions. I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She’s working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities. Any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations. She wants to know how we are going to help her. How we’re going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage. Senator Warren said, “Show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you’ll show me your values.” She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that. There’s no argument there. I just want to make sure that we’re lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit- -or child tax credit, which we will do in my administration. But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase? On this much, we agree. I just want to know if working families are going to get a tax increase. Yes, we must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world’s greatest democracy, and being able to do it, thanks to Donald Trump, functionally, with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now, as we speak, still at the invitation of this President. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward. But in addition, [foreign language 01:25:23], to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage? We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn’t enough money in this country, there aren’t enough service members, as brave and courageous as they are, to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world. And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS, not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there. And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers: one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power, and make sure that we invest in diplomacy in our State Department, and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals. Not on the backs of 18, and 19, and 20 year olds anymore. But making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make sure that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world. Look, we’re going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it’s not right, and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s. Those are weapons of war. That they were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton, nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country. So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they’re also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror. Just ask Hispanics in Texas, Univision surveyed them, more than 80% feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this President’s racism and hatred that he’s directed at communities like mine in El Paso. So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now. We don’t go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non gun owners alike- … to respect and follow the law. If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from law enforcement. But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing. This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis, and we’ve got to do something about it. And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I’m describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks, and red flag laws, and that we end the sale of these weapons of war. But to use the analogy of healthcare, it would be as though we said, “Look, we’re for primary care, but let’s not talk about mental healthcare because that’s a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let’s save that for another day.” No, let’s decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and then let’s bring this country together in order to do that. Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who march for our lives, who in fact came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan- … that calls for mandatory buybacks. Let’s follow their inspiration and lead, and not be limited by the polls, and the consultants, and the focus groups. Let’s do what’s right- … while we have time to do what’s right. That’s a mischaracterization. Anderson, I’ve got answered this. Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue. But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don’t care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who’ve lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47. March For Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics, and poll-tested politicians. That was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups, and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47. We must buy them back. [crosstalk 00:01:36:15]. Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described, and also just from some personal experiences I’ve had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions. I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA. Now imagine that veteran instead of being prescribed an opioid had been prescribed marijuana, because we made that legal in America, insured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who have been arrested for possession, and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted. I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we’re going to continue to have this problem going on again. So, that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system. They’re an opportunity for our public health system [crosstalk 01:49:50]- Yeah. We need to set very tough, very clear transparent rules of the road. The kind of rules that we do not have today. That allow these social media platforms, where we the people have become the product, to abuse that public trust. To do so at extraordinary profits. Right now we treat them functionally as a utility. When in reality they’re more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others. We would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing. To publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the Vice President. Treat them like the publisher that they are. That’s what I will do as president. We will be unafraid to breakup big businesses if we have to do that. But I don’t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That’s something that Donald Trump has done. In part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It’s not something that we should do. Tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy and data. Be fearless in the face of these tech giants. There was some talk about getting big things done. When I was first elected to Congress I found that El Paso, Texas had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental healthcare provider at the VA. I don’t know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country, or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I served. We set about turning around the VA. Hiring up the psychiatrists, and psychologists, and therapists to take care of those women and men who’d put their lives on the line for this country. We were able to do that. We took what we learned and we applied it to a national law. As a member of the minority, working with Republicans and Democrats alike, to expand mental healthcare access for veterans nationally. Then in Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county- … talking about this progressive agenda and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won. That’s the way that we defeat Donald Trump in- … November of 2020. I’ve always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges regardless of the differences. I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas. Did it as a member of the city council where I saw my colleagues, not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow EL Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community. As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio, I was visiting the VA there March of 2017. I found that my flight had been snowed in Washington, D.C. Happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd and on a whim I said, “Do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?” And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala last car on the lot, it was spring break, drove 1600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat, finding out what we had in common. By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other’s bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats can work together on an otherwise contentious issue. And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than in any Democrat. We want independence and Republicans in record numbers as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity. We will make the most of this moment that we have here together. It’s an honor to be on this debate stage. It is wonderful to be back in Texas, in Houston, back here at TSU. On August 3rd in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country. The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is. The cost and the consequence of his presidency. Racism and violence that had long had been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas. Where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured, by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place. Inspired to kill by our president. The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another, and try to make differences without distinctions. Mountains out of molehills. We have to be bigger. We have to see clearly. We have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That’s what I want to do for you as President of the United States. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I’m grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge, and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now. But I also think we’re being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing 10s of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the Vice President does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for in a state like Texas where the largest provider of mental healthcare services is the county jail system. We’ve got to do better. In my proposal, Medicare for America, say everyone who’s uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who’s insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare, and those like members of unions, who fought for the healthcare plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them. That is the best possible path forward. I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then, and I was talking about it long before then as well. Racism in America is endemic, it is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the 4th of July 1776, but August 20th 1619, when the first kidnapped African was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave build the greatness, the success, and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy. We have to be able to answer this challenge, and it is found in our education system where in Texas a five year old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended, or expelled, based on the color of their skin. In our healthcare system where there is a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there’s 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America. I’m going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee’s lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundations. But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House, and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country. That’s all right. That sounds good. I am. If it’s a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. If the high impact, high velocity round when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that. So that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR15 and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour. Because so many other people were shot by that AR15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren’t enough ambulances to get to them in time. Yes. We’re going to take your AR15, your AK47. We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore. And I want to say this, I’m listening to the people of this country. The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas to meet with those who are selling AR15s and AK47s and those who are buying those weapons. And you might be surprised there was some common ground there. Folks who said, “I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces. I don’t need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.” So let’s do the right thing but let’s bring everyone in America into the conversation. Republicans, Democrats, gun owners and non gun owners alike. I do, and if you read the rest of that article in the Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa overstays but I think the larger question that we’re trying to get at is how do we rewrite this country’s immigration laws in our own image? In the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America. In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants, safe because we are a city of immigrants. [foreign language 00:25:12]. I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way, never cage another child. Make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody. But also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job. That we have been part of deporting people hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone who pose no threat to this country, breaking up their families. Democrats have to get off the back foot, we have to lead on this issue because we know it is right. Legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million dreamers. Make them US citizens right now in this, their true home country, and extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers, and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here. Yes, we will follow through regardless of the political consequences or who it offends, because this is the very future of our planet and our ability for our children and grandchildren to be able to survive on it. We will make sure that we get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than the year 2050, that we are halfway there by 2030, that we mobilize $5 trillion over the next 10 years to do that, that we invest here in Houston, Texas with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding. Given the fact that this town has seen three 500-year floods in just five years, you’d like to think you’re good for 1,500 years, but you’re not. They’re coming faster, and larger, and more devastating than ever. We’re also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that. And then we’re going to pay farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil. That’s the way that we’re going to meet this challenge, and we’re going to bring everyone into the solution. Thank you, George. Everything that I’ve learned about resilience, I’ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community in large part by the President of the United States that killed 22 people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that nor were we defined by that. The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country. We don’t see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength and to our security and to our safety. Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims. He’s the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girl’s soccer team of ten and 11 year old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He’s still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he’s still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team. Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica and Marcella, their wives, they exemplify resilience to me. When we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we’re defined not by our fears but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set. Thank you. I’m running for president because I believe that America discovers its greatness at its moments of greatest need. This moment will define us forever and I believe that in this test, America will be redeemed. In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president, we will choose to be the nation that stands up for the human rights of everyone, for the rule of law for everyone. And a democracy that serves everyone. Whatever our differences, we know that before we are anything else, we are Americans first. And we will ensure that each one of us is well enough and educated enough and paid enough to realize our full potential. We will meet these challenges here at home and we will lead the world in those that we face abroad. Successfully confronting endless war and climate change. At this moment of truth, let us pursue our national promise and make a more perfect union of everyone, by everyone and for everyone. The answer is no. The middle-class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class healthcare. I think we’re being offered a false choice. Some who want to improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins. Others who want a Medicare for All program that will force people off of private insurance. I have a better path, Medicare for America. Everyone who is uninsured is enrolled in Medicare tomorrow. Those who are insufficiently insured are enrolled in Medicare, and those who have employer-sponsored insurance- [crosstalk 00:20:38] Jake, this is important. You have some, Governor Bullock, who said that we will improve the Affordable Care Act at the margins with a public option. You have others to my right who are talking about taking away people’s choice for the private insurance they have or members of unions. I was listening to D. Taylor in Nevada. His members want to healthcare that they fought for. [crosstalk 00:20:57] Every estimate that I’ve seen of expanding ACA even through a public option still leaves millions of people uninsured and also means that people are not guaranteed the health care that they need. As the examples that Senator Warren showed us, our plan ensures that everyone is enrolled in Medicare or can keep their employer-sponsored insurance. When we listen to the American people and this is what they want us to do, they want everyone covered, but they want to be able to maintain choice and our plan does that. I do. Because in my administration, after we have waived citizenship fees for green card holders, more than 9-million of our fellow Americans freed dreamers from any fear of deportation and stopped criminally prosecuting families and children for seeking asylum and refuge and for-profit detention in this country, and then assist those countries in Central America so that no family ever has to make that 2,000-mile journey. Then I expect that people who come here follow our laws and we reserve the right to criminally prosecute them if they do not. How else can we explain that we lose nearly 40,000 people in this country to gun violence? A number that no other country comes even close to, that we know what all the solutions are and yet nothing has changed? It is because in this country, money buys influence, access, and increasingly, outcomes. The Centers of Disease Control prevented from actually studying the issue in the first place. As president, we will make sure that we ban political action committee contributions to any member of Congress or any candidate for federal office. We will listen to people, not packs. People, not corporations. People, not special interests. Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete. There’s a new battleground state, Texas, and it has 38 electoral college votes and the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those 254 counties. No matter how red or rural, we did not write you off. No matter how blue or urban, we did not take you for granted, and we didn’t trim our sales either. We had the courage of our convictions, talking about universal healthcare, comprehensive immigration reform, and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late. We brought everyone in, and now we have a chance to beat Donald Trump in Texas. I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments. As a member of Congress, when I learned that the El Paso VA had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country, meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied, and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the VA in El Paso. We took that lesson nationally, and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand mental health care to veterans, and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing, Donald Trump. To show that, at the end of the day, we will put the American people first before party, before any other concern. I’ve listened to scientists on this, and they’re very clear. We don’t have more than 10 years to get this right, and we won’t meet that challenge with half steps or half measures or only half the country. We’ve got to bring everyone in. The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week, they want the challenge, they want those jobs, they want to create the future for this country and the world. Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the country, and those farmers in Iowa say, “Pay me for the environmental services, the planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements.” That’s how we meet the challenge. We do it with everyone in this country. We bring everyone into the solution. We’ll call his racism out for what it is. And also talk about its consequences. It doesn’t just offend our sensibilities to hear him say, “Send her back.” About a member of Congress because she’s a woman of color, because she’s a Muslim American. It doesn’t just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith. It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are on the rise every single one of the last three years. On the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground. So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election. But we must also ensure that we don’t just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them. That’s what we’ve learned in El Paso, Texas, my hometown, one of the safest cities in the United States of America. Not despite, but because it’s a city of immigrants and asylum seekers and refugees. We will show that our diversity- … Is our strength, in my administration. I want to acknowledge something that we’re all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country. The wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet, was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force. The legacy of slavery and segregation and Jim Crow and suppression is alive and well in every aspect of the economy and in the country today. As president, I will sign into law and new Voting Rights Act. I will focus on education, address healthcare disparities. But I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee’s reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we’ve waited too long in this country to have. The question was about tariffs, and they’re a huge mistake. They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences. When have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies and friends and partners? As president, we will hold China accountable, but we will bring our allies and friends like the European Union to bear and we’ll also negotiate trade deals that favor farmers and American workers and protect human rights and the environment and labor, not just here in the United States- … but in the [crosstalk 00:05:52]. I support free two-year college. Earn that associate’s degree, realize your full potential. Debt-free four-year college, but unlike some of the other candidates on the stage, that’s not just for tuition. That is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country. And then for that school teacher who in many places like Texas is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for outstanding student loan debt, forgiveness for that person willing to work at the VA and serve our former service members. And we do not do that at the expense of unions. We elevate them as well and make it easier to join an apprenticeship to learn a skill or a trade that you can command for the rest of your life. I would in my first term in office. Agree that there is nothing about perpetuating this war already in its 18th year that will make it any better. We’ve satisfied the reasons for our involvement in Afghanistan in the first place, and it’s time to bring those service members back home from Afghanistan, but also from Iraq, also from Yemen and Somalia and Libya and Syria. There is no reason for us to be at war all over the world tonight. As president, I will end those wars and we will not start new wars. We will not send more US service members overseas to sacrifice their lives and to take the lives of others in our name. We can resolve- … these challenges peacefully and diplomatically. We are as divided and polarized as a country as we have ever been. Right now we have a President who uses fear to try to drive us further apart. To meet this challenge, we have to have hope in one another and a faith in a future of this country that includes everyone. My whole life I’ve been including people in the success of this country. Starting a business with high value, high wage, high skilled jobs in the third poorest urban county in America. Serving on the city council and holding town hall meetings every single week to remind myself who it is that I serve at the end of the day. In Congress, being in the minority but working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver for my constituents and this country. Then in Texas this last year, traveling to every county not writing anybody off, not taking anyone for granted. At the end of the day, winning more votes than any Democrat had in the history of the state. Winning independence for the first time in decades, and winning nearly half a million Republicans and those 38 Electoral College votes in Texas are now in play. I can win them. That is how we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020 and how we bring this divided country together again in January of 2021. Thank you. This economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn’t, and it’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does, [foreign language 00:03:47] Right now we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That’s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest, a $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality. A new democracy that is revived because we’ve returned power to the people, no packs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now. That’s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody. I would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital- … at the same rate that you tax ordinary income. Take that corporate tax rate up to 28%- … you would generate the revenues you need to pay for the programs we’re talking about. My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care. In Laredo, Texas I met a young man, 27 years old, told me that he’d been to a doctor once in his life and on that visit he was told he had diabetes. He was told he had glaucoma and he was told, untreated because he doesn’t have health care, he’ll be dead before the age of 40. Getting to guaranteed high quality universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal. The ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, the ability to see a mental healthcare provider … In Texas, the single provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today. Health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible. Our plan says if you’re uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you’re insufficiently insured, you can’t afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you’re a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you- … your family … you’re able to keep it. We preserve choice by making sure- No. I think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for. [crosstalk 00:21:29] That’s right so for those- … for whom it’s not working, [crosstalk 00:21:41] they can choose Medicare. Right? For those not working, they can choose Medicare. For the [inaudible 00:21:43] workers in Nevada who I listened to, who negotiated for those plans, they’re able to keep them. Tonight in this country, you have 2.3 million of our fellow Americans behind bars. It’s the largest prison population on the face of the planet. Many are there for nonviolent drug crimes, including possession of marijuana, at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it, and yet, despite what Purdue Pharma has done, their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country, they’ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences, not a single night in jail. Unless there’s accountability and justice this crisis will continue. In my administration we will hold them to account. We will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those who’ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country, get them treatment and long-term care. [inaudible 00:06:16] We would not turn back Valeria and her father Oscar. We would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws. We would not build walls. We would not put kids in cages. In fact, we would spare no [crosstalk 00:06:35] expense to reunite the families that have been separated already. [crosstalk 00:06:40] And we would not criminally prosecute any family because who was fleeing violence and persecution. We would make sure we implemented… We would not detain any family fleeing violence. In fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today. We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost, and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image. Free dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them US citizens here in this country, invest in solutions in Central America, work with regional stakeholders so there’s no reason to make [crosstalk 00:07:20] that 2000 mile journey to this country. Let me respond to this very briefly. [crosstalk 00:07:59] Actually as a member of Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country. If you’re fleeing… If you’re fleeing desperation, then I want to make sure [crosstalk 00:08:12] treated with respect. you’re looking at just one small part of this. I’m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws. And if you do that, [crosstalk 00:08:22] I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country. If we apprehend a known smuggler or drug trafficker, we’re going to make sure that they are deported and criminally prosecuted. Here’s how we had that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting. A young student named Bri, her friend Marcel who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Heart… They talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. Talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities. Red flag laws, so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they’re stopped before it’s too late. And what I found in each one of those 254 counties, is that Democrats, and Independents, and Republicans, gun owners and non-gun owners alike agreed. But this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida and they’ve been able to change those laws. They’re making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass. I think you’ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face. That’s why we’re traveling everywhere, listening to everyone. We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningly flooded before, just up against the Missouri River in Iowa, and every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes. Those farms already underwater in debt, their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration, and now they don’t know what to do. We, in our administration, are going to fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We’re going to mobilize five trillion dollars in this economy over the next 10 years. We’re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels. And we’re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver’s seat. Renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil. Paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. If all of us does all that we can, then we’re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another two degrees Celsius and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential. John, I appreciate the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward. But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He’s diminished our standing in the world and he’s made us weaker as a country. Less able to confront challenges, whether it’s Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same. He’s embraced strong men and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together. That makes America stronger. xistential threat is climate change. We have to confront it before it’s too late. Yes, and I’ll tell you why. ne of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States capital is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress at the height of his power submitting to the rule of law and the will of people. That has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years. If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand. So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we followed them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy. And if we have not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability, and there is justice. Its the only way that we save this country. daughter Molly turned 11 this week. I’m on the stage for her, for children across this country, including some her same age who’ve been separated from their parents, and are sleeping on concrete floors, under aluminum blankets, tonight. If we’re going to be there for them, if we’re going to confront the challenges that we face, we can’t return to the same old approach. We’re going to need a new kind of politics, one directed by the urgency of the next generation. Those climate activists who are fighting not just for their future, but for everyone’s. Those students, not marching for their lives, but for all of ours. We’ll need a movement like the one that we led in Texas. It renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in, and writing nobody off. That’s how we beat Donald Trump, and that’s how we bring this great country together again. Join us. This is our moment, and the generations that follow us are counting on us to meet it.'"

      "yes and i think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where were going to go forward martin luther king once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly so when there is racism in the criminal justice system then we need to fix it and to me that means sentencing reform like the first step act and extending that to the states with the second step act it means equal opportunity because if we dont pass representative clyburns bill out of south carolina here to invest in impoverished communities were never going to get to that single garment of destiny and we also need to do something about child care about making sure we increase the minimum wage and then finally voting while we are all sitting here debating wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands … of people off of their voting rolls georgia kicked  off as president … i will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone hey no norah norah norah norah bernie let me respond to this no the math does not add up in fact just on  minutes this weekend he said he wasnt going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes well let me tell you how many nickels and dimes were … the nickels and the dimes well let me tell you how many nickels and dimes were talking about nearly  trillion do you know how much that is for all of his programs that is three times the american economy not the federal government the entire american economy the medicare for all plan alone page eight clearly says that it will kick  million americans off their current health insurance in four years that is true as one prominent democrat once said we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are bernie that prominent democrat was barack obama a few months ago and i think thats what we should do they are not with you on spending nearly  trillion what i think we should do is make things more affordable nonprofit public option make sure were paying for longterm care better take on the pharmaceuticals like you and i have done together and do something for the people of america instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers i was talking about all your programs all i know if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart were going to watch donald trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart so my argument here is that we need to get back to whats happening right now we have a clear choice of whos going to lead this party and i am the only one in the new hampshire debate when asked if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket that raise my hand i like bernie we came in together to the senate but i do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket and if you want to talk about getting things done and come make a comparison according to vanderbilt university in tennessee last congress i was the most effective democrat in the us senate on  metrics bernie and elizabeth were in the bottom half it matters it matters if you can actually get things done it is not just who talks to the best who actually gets things done and especially with the african american community there have been a lot of broken promises and i think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for this people matters  but the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually need the votes so i have long supported the assault weapon ban i am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers cant go out and get an  that bill along with … you didnt write that bill okay you did that okay well have a fact check look at this … oh my goodness okay so if i could finish i have the bill … anyone can check it out … to close the boyfriend loophole also to close the charleston loophole is another bill thats out there universal background checks but let me say how we win this weve got to win in the middle of the country and while everyone talks about winning rural areas suburban areas im the only one up here with the receipts that has actually repeatedly while being for the assault weapon ban won in republican congressional districts over and over again including michele bachmanns district so having someone that can lead the ticket that can bring people with her is the way you get gun safety legislation i look at these proposals and say do they hurt my uncle dick in the deer stand they do not so coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key thank you this is one of the first times weve talked about housing and i put forward an extensive policy i think when ive looked at this both in my job in local government and in the senate one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live so the way you do that is first of all taking care of this section  backlog of applicants there are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting and i have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing secondly you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and third to help people pay for it and i want to make clear given south carolina and the rural population as well as urban that this isnt just an urban problem its a big urban problem but its also a rural problem where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there but theyre not able to get housing so for me its building a coalition and i actually like to get these things done and the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done people arent always aware i know you are in south carolina about how much poverty there is particularly child poverty in rural areas so the answer is one size doesnt fit all and one of the ways you do this right now we have something called critical access hospitals so theyre designated for rural areas and actually i am the lead democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered the other issue is we dont have enough personnel and so thats where we get to this education plan and i dont agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college what i think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy were going to have a million openings for home healthcare workers particularly in rural areas that we dont know how to fill were going to have over  openings for nursing assistants were not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees were going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses so putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback making one and two year degrees free and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go especially medical students into rural areas final thing is comprehensive immigration reform i have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas we need to expand that well it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana i want to do that too and i also think you need to look back at peoples records and you maybe cant do it on day one as he said i think you want to have a process that you go through because theres too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs i think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment and its not necessarily because of marijuana it is because of things like opioids and the like and thats why one of the first plans i put out was for treatment because if you want to make the criminal justice system work you dont want to have repeat customers and you want to help people to get off of drugs and the way you do that is with drug courts the way you do that by the way is with my proposal for a clemency board in the white house so that you dont have a president that pellmell gives pardons to his buddies and to white collar offenders but that instead you have a set process that you use thats fair and is outside of the justice department and while getting their advice why dont we let me answer then you well what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those americans and that they are in a quarantine situation we dont want to expose people but we want to give them help and i would agree when mayor bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget he tried to cut back on the cdc he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world he hasnt yet really addressed the nation on this topic i would do all of that but i want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the american people because this is so serious im not going to give my website right now im going to give the cdcs website which is cdcgov so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their healthcare provider because many doctors are saying its just a matter of time before were going to start seeing this here and i think the answers… as president what would i do i would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one i would have better relations with our allies and i would support… because i know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school in columbia south carolina or houston texas and its investing in education so we are ready to lead again in the world donald trumps bernie donald trumps worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for and i was going to comment on cuba policy because i actually lead the bill to lift the embargo i went with barack obama when he went to cuba and ive seen firsthand how the cuban people are way in front of their leaders they like america they want to be entrepreneurs and the way that we embrace them and not the socialist regime is by opening up cuba and starting to do business with them but to get at what we were just talking about i just think we have a huge choice super tuesday states one third of america will vote do you want to have someone in charge of this ticket could i finish margaret we want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward  trillion in spending three times the american economy i dont think we do i think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that were going to turn off the voters that we need to bring in i would but not in the way this president has done it he literally thinks he can go over and bring a hot dish to the dictator next door and he thinks everythings going to be fine he has not done it with our allies he has literally just hastily called summit and run off that is no way to do it and as you can see north korea is emboldened theyre still launching missiles they promised a christmas surprise that thankfully never happened and he has not been able to advance the ball at all so what would i do i would work with our allies and it has been pointed out this is what this president fails at all the time we should be negotiating ourselves back into the iran nuclear agreement we should be working with russia not only to stand up for the protection of our elections and call vladimir putin out for what he is the ruthless dictator that takes down planes that poisons dissidence but that also at the same time we have to acknowledge that we should be renegotiating the new start treaty and the other arms negotiations that must happen this president just likes to do tweets at  am in his bathrobe gets out there and doesnt achieve the results we need i would meet with him but i would do it with our allies i would have clear deliverables and i would achieve those deliverables id say the biggest … the biggest misconception is that im boring because im not i would say that my motto is the words of one of my political mentors paul wellstone whos sadly no longer with us and he said that politics is about improving peoples lives and thats been my life from when my grandpa was an iron ore miner and the unions politics made them those mines safer and when my dad needed treatment it was there for him and in his words he was pursued by grace and when my mom got divorced and she didnt have a job and she went back to teaching and that gift of public service got her through and then when our daughter was born oh i thought we had a minute to answer the question my motto was that politics is about improving peoples lives pretty good one i think the path is a high voter turnout im the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when i led the tip ticket as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters and ive done that as well and im the only one with the receipts to have done that in republican congressional districts over and over again but i want to say this i actually welcomed mayor bloomberg to the stage i thought that he shouldnt be hiding behind his tv ads and so i was already for this big day and then i looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way that is what his campaign said because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee i have been told as a woman as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage but i am because of pure grit and because of the people out there ive been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside and im not going to do that now and im not going to do that because a campaign memo from mayor bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him i think we need something different than donald trump i dont think you look at donald trump and say we need someone richer in the white house i have an idea i have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet we could nominate a woman for candidate for president of the united states i think that might go a long way if we showed our stuff as a party and the other thing im going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between senator sanders and the culinary union and that is this these are hardworking people housekeepers like elizabeth and i met with last night who have healthcare plans that have been negotiated over time sweat and blood and that is the truth for so many americans right now there are  million americans that would lose their current health insurance under senator sanders bill thats what it says on page eight and i dont think we should forget that i must say personal offense since post it notes were invented in my state  okay so my plan is a public option and according to all the studies out there it would reduce premiums for  million people immediately it would expand coverage for about that same number it is a significant thing it is what barack obama wanted to do from the very beginning and the way i look at it since were in vegas when it comes to your plan elizabeth and bernies on medicareforall you dont put your money on a number thats not even on the wheel and why is medicareforall not on the wheel why is it not on the wheel because two thirds of the democratic senators are not even on that bill because a bunch of the new house members that got elected see the problems with blowing up the affordable care act they see it right in front of them and the truth is that when you see some troubled waters you dont blow up a bridge you build one and so we need to improve the affordable care act not blow it up okay thats it first ill start with that case it is very clear that any evidence if there is new evidence even old evidence it should be reviewed by that office and by the county attorney that must happen i have called for that review this was a case involving an  africanamerican girl named tyesha edwards who was shot doing her homework at her kitchen table three people were convicted one of the cases is the one that is being investigated … was investigated by a journalist and i think its very important that that evidence come forward in terms of the police shootings that you noted those went to a grand jury every single one of them and i made very clear for months now that like so many prosecutors i think those cases in my time they were all going to the grand jury it was thought that was the best way to handle them in many many jurisdictions i actually did speak up on something very similar and that was when our police chief in minneapolis tried to take the investigations of police shootings into his own hands i strongly said i disagreed with that now i do believe also that a prosecutor should make those decisions herself and the last thing i will say because you asked the question about voting i have the support of africanamericans in my community in every election i had strong support and strong support of leadership and thats because i earned it and this is going to be on me to earn it you earn it with what you stand for when it comes to equal opportunity you earn it with the work that i have done the leadership ive shown on voting rights and yes you earn it with the work that must be done on criminal justice reform can i comment on that im just looking at my husband in the front row that has to like do our taxes all the time we probably could go to turbo tax and the point of this is i believe in transparency i had a physical by the way it came out well we might all be surprised if my blood pressure is lower than mayor petes that might really shock everyone out there and i think you should release your records from your physical secondly when it comes to tax returns everyone up here has released their tax returns mayor and it is a major issue because the president of the united states has been hiding behind his tax returns even when courts order him to come forward with those tax returns i dont care how much money anyone has i think its great you got a lot of money but i think youve got to come forward with your tax returns of course of course and i dont think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what i know about mexico and how much i care about it and i first want to say greetings to president lopez obrador secondly what i meant the game of jeopardy is that i think we could all come up with things you know how many members are there in the israeli knesset  who is the president of honduras hernandez when it comes to mexico i am the one person on this stage that came out first to say i was for the us mexican canadian trade agreement that is going to be one of the number one duties of a president is to implement that yes thats right and i said that i made an error i think having a president that maybe is humble and is able to admit that here and there maybe wouldnt be a bad thing well there you go are you trying to say that im dumb are you mocking me here pete i said i made an error people sometimes forget names i am the one that has number one has the experience based on passing over  bills if i could respond this was a pretty big allegation hes basically saying that i dont have the experience to be president of the united states i have passed over  bills as the lead democrat since being in the us senate i am the one not you that has won statewide in congressional district after congressional district and i will say when you tried in indiana pete to run what happened to you you lost by over  points to someone who later lost to my friend joe donnelly so dont tell me about experience what unites us here is we want to win and i think we should put a proven winner in charge of the ticket i do have to respond  you have just invoked my name again and i ask you to look at the interview i did directly after the forum which we went into great detail on latin american policy and i want to say one thing about mayor pete where we just disagree he was asked on a debate stage about the mexican cartels which are bad bad criminal organizations he said that he would be open to classifying them as terrorist organizations i actually dont agree with that that is a very valid debate to have i dont think that would be good for our security coordination with mexico and i think you got that wrong  i made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that its safe but it is a transitional fuel and i want to add something that really hasnt been brought up by my colleagues this is a crisis and a lot of our plans are very similar to get to carbon neutral by   something like that but were not going to be able to pass this unless we bring people with us im looking at these incredible senators from nevada catherine cortez masto and jacky rosen and im thinking that they know how important this is and you can do this in a smart way one get back into that international climate change agreement two clean power rules bring those back a president can do this herself without congress as well as the gas mileage standards but when it comes to putting a sweep a price on carbon … this is very important chuck we have to make sure that that money goes back directly as dividends to the people that are going to need help for paying their bills otherwise were not going to pass it so there has to be a heart to the policy to get this done can i respond she  i was just i was thinking there was going to be a rematch on saturday in vegas and those guys should go down there okay i believe in capitalism but i think the goal of someone in government and a president of the united states should be a check on that im not going to limit what people make but i think right now our tax code is so tilted against regular people and that is whats wrong i was thinking of your question about small businesses the small businesses i talked to they have trouble getting employees because their employees dont have childcare we should have universal childcare and we have not been talking enough about donald trump and lets just talk about donald trump because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy and he went down maralago and he said to all his friends you just got a lot richer that is exhibit a and i can tell you the hardworking people in nevada were not in that room so the key to me is to not limit what people can make but make sure that we have a government that is fair for everyone seriously elizabeth thank you number one i have repeatedly said that we have to win big and the way we win big is winning states like nevada but also winning the senate races in arizona and in colorado and beyond and the reason we want to do that is to send mitch mcconnell packing and i think when you look at my history i am the one that has done that i am the one that can lead this ticket and just because i am willing to talk about common ground thats where america is it is not with mitch mcconnell who has  bills on his desk that should pass if we get rid of him it is because i am willing to work with people and find common ground thats what we want in a president elisabeth we dont want someone that looks at just plans and different to win to beat donald trump the best way to protect the dreamers is to have a new president there are the votes there to protect the dreamers and i have been working on this since i got to the united states senate in my first campaign i actually had a bunch of ads run against me because i was standing up for immigrants and when i think of dreamers and i tried to explain it to my state i found a  hispanic war veteran who was a dreamer when he was brought over to this country and back then he just went to canada for a night and came back and he was a permanent citizen because they needed him to serve in world war ii now not so easy the dreamers are our future the dreamers are so important in nevada and the best way we can get this done is to beat donald trump but it is to pass comprehensive immigration reform which creates a path to citizenship to so many hardworking people who will bring down the deficit by  billion and will bring peace for these dreamers they know no other country but our own i wish everyone was as perfect as you pete but let me tell you what its like to be in the arena number one do the math if my friend andrew yang was up here thats what hed say in fact i have opposed not supported twothirds of the trump judges so get your numbers right and i am in the top  to  of opposing them number two when it comes to immigration reform … number two when it comes to immigration reform the things that you are referring to that official that you are referring to was supported by about half the democrats including someone in this room i will say this he was highly recommended by the obama officials you know why because trump had so few career people i did not one bit agree with these draconian policies to separate kids from their parents in my first  days i would immediately change that i would add one more thing i have been in the arena … ted kennedy … he had made a pretty big allegation against me again i think i should have a right to respond he had … ted kennedy just first of all … it is what youve said about … the judges are false you are comparing me to two colleagues up here on this stage and you are forgetting one thing you know what pete if you could let me finish since ive been in the arena ted kennedy asked me to work on the first immigration bill we were able with president bush to at least get that bill to a vote im sorry but senator sanders actually opposed that bill i worked on it if we had gotten that bill done there would have been a path to citizenship for so many people then i worked on the  bill im actually so proud of  the work ive done on immigration reform you know what you have not been in the arena doing that work youve memorized a bunch of talking points and a bunch of things but i can tell you one thing what the people of this country want they want a leader that has the heart for the immigrants of this country that is me let the process work this has been quite a debate what i want everyone out there watching to remember is that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us that we need a candidate that can bring people with her yes a fired up democratic base but also independents and moderate republicans ive done that every single time i have won every race down to fourth grade a lot of boasting up here so i thought id add that secondly you need someone who can govern i have passed over  bills as the lead democrat third you need someone that has the heart to be the president they were talking a lot about heart conditions up here we have a president right now that doesnt have a heart i love the people of this country i ask for the vote of the people of nevada because this state gets it they get that maybe you dont agree with every single thing thats said on this debate stage but we understand that the heart of america is bigger than any heart … that guy has in the white house i ask you to join me at amyklobucharcom thank you bernie and i work together all the time but i think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief and i think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her instead of shutting them out and when i look at a state like new hampshire that had a very very close election last time in  i see a state that yes has a high voter turnout firedup democrats just like my state which by the way bernie when i led the ticket had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country but i add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate republicans because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate and truthfully donald trumps worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle the people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense and they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else and i would submit that that is me i keep listening to this same debate and it is not real it is not real bernie because two thirds of the democrats in the senate are not on your bill and because it would kick  million americans off their current health insurance in four years and let me say what else elizabeth wants to do it in two years and pete while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said henceforth forewith indubitably affirmatively you are for medicare for all for the ages and so i would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position looking at things and sticking with them i have long believed that the way that we expand healthcare to more people and bring down premiums is by building on the affordable care act with a nonprofit public option that is the best way to do it and practically look at this the affordable care act is now nearly  points more popular than the president of united states so why would we talk about blowing it up what we need to do is build on it mental health care addiction longterm care those are the things that would make it better for everyone i am listening to this about meeting the moment and my first thought is im a fresh face up here for a presidential debate and i figure pete that  my age is the new  up here the second thing i think about is this and that is okay there you go meeting the moment meeting the moment we had a moment the last few weeks mayor and that moment was these impeachment hearings and there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people there was courage from doug jones our friend of alabama who took that tough vote there was courage from mitt romney who took it very very difficult vote there was courage as i read today about lieutenant colonel vindman being escorted out of the white house what he did took courage but what you said pete as you were campaigning through iowa as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing you said it was exhausting to watch and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons it is easy to go after washington because thats a popular thing to do it is much harder as i see senator shaheen in the front row such a leader it is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions because i think this going after every single thing that people do because its popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer i just i dont think thats what people want right now we have a newcomer in the white house and look where it got us i think having some experience is a good thing i like bernie just fine we actually have worked together on a number of things including pharmaceuticals we actually had a vote late at night one time klobuchar sanders amendment to bring in less nope nope nope it was not it was not to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries since in this great state of new hampshire like in minnesota and vermont we can see canada from our porch and we ended up getting i think  republican votes and they might not have noticed what was happening late at night but we got those and i think that it is just an example of what we need to do here because ive been listening to this discussion i agree with my colleagues we must unite but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for america that is what we must do and that means taking on a president if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on taking on a president that literally went down to maralago after he signed that republican tax bill and looked at all his friends and said you just got a lot richer that is exhibit a for those carpenters in pennsylvania and those dairy farmers in wisconsin and those dock workers that i met with in michigan that is an exhibit a and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country some of whom voted for donald trump that we have something better to offer that we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill and put that money into their childcare into their healththere that i dont know i know we did on that bill but the point is i think were better off with someone that has the receipts someone that has actually won big time with republicans and independents and im the only one up on this stage you can check it out that has consistently won in red congressional districts not once not twice but three times and when i did this i didnt just do it for me i led a ticket ive flipped the state house every single time because i have a way of working with people that i think should be valued here as we look at these candidates and its one of the reasons that i got the new york times endorsement along with elizabeth and that i got the endorsements of the three major papers here in new hampshire which is the union leader the seacoast papers and the keene sentinel i think that matters read those editorials and you will get a sense of what im about well you the conway endorsement there we go i led one of the most successful drug courts in the country in hennepin county and i always would say and believed and i think my record shows this that we werent a business we didnt want to see repeat customers and if you dont want to see repeat customers the only answer is treatment and maybe youre referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs yes i felt that we should prosecute those people but when it comes to when you asked mr yang a question and i think it we owe it to the people of new hampshire had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed ive been very clear about this theres going to be a major settlement coming through a federal settlement against all these opioid manufacturers the evidence is overwhelming including an email where one guy a business guy says to the other theyre eating them like doritos just keep pumping them out we will get a conservative estimate  billion in from that settlement we can put a  cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another  billion then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in  billion and just like every other policy ive proposed and i think new hampshire voters should care about this i have showed how im going to pay for it because i think we have someone in the white house that has told over  lies he makes all kinds of promises the people of new hampshire and the people of our country deserve better i will get this done and it is personal for me thank you i would only appoint judges that would respect precedent and one of those key precedents is roe v wade in addition you have got to put it into law donald trump and i think its really important to take it to him here when he was running for election and this is a case i will make on the debate stage against him he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail he then dialed it back and said no i want to put doctors in jail is it a big surprise then were seeing states like alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions its not and that is why its going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding planned parenthood for making sure women have access to contraception to making sure that they have a right to choose that we make this case strongly and loudly yes yes i did because i think in addition to the economic argument were making here with the sad sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in new orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby and  of african american kids being living in poverty we know that there are economic solutions here to invest in those communities housing childcare but theres something else insidious going on that we havent addressed and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting that is moves across the country to limit peoples right to vote and that is why i have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn  there is no reason that we cant do that across this country to stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state and yes to stop the voting purges because what is going on right now in the words of one north carolina court is that they are discriminating with surgical precision against african american voters and we are not going to be able to get any of these things done if we dont give people the right to vote so i cant stand the big money in politics and one of my major focuses is going to be on passing that constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united i didnt come from money and i just simply think people dont look at the guy in the white house and say can we get someone richer i dont think they think that they want to have someone that they can understand and you know my background my grandpa was an iron ore miner he worked  feet underground in the mines his whole life he couldnt even graduate from high school because he had to raise his nine brothers and sisters my grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to a two year community college that was my familys trust and you cant send like donald trump got from his family you cant fit  million in a coffee can my mom grew up and wanted to be a teacher in wisconsin she moved to minnesota she taught second grade until she was  years old and no i am not a billionaire but i stand before you today as granddaughter of an iron ore miner the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman the first woman elected to the us senate from the state of minnesota someone who has passed over  bills as a lead democrat in that gridlock in washington dc and that is because we live in a country of shared dreams and that means no matter where you come from no matter where you come from you should be able to make it so please help me in my efforts at amyklobucharcom this is a campaign of real people well first of all i want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from new hampshire jeanne shaheen and maggie hassan who work so hard for this state every day and i voted with them why did i vote with them because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change i think we have to have a north american trading block we have to have mexico and canada and america working together and the best way to take on climate change as president yes ill work to make this a part of every future trade agreement but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement which i will do on day one it is bringing back the clean power rules it is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that and in future trade agreements that should be part of our negotiations but im telling you right now having no trade agreement with canada and mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with china and pushing china to do better when it comes to climate change one of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things arent always exactly how you would do them but in this case if you want to criticize trump for not ever having any friends and i would agree he always sides with tyrants over innocents he always sides with dictators over allies but i think youve got to have some friends and those two countries our neighbors may not be perfect but they are our friends and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world and we have not talked about this enough he blames barack obama for everything that goes wrong he blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself he blames the king of denmark who does that he blames the prime minister of canada for he claims cutting him out of the canadian version of home alone  who does that thats what donald trump does so my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies and new hampshire is such a great example of this new hampshire bretton woods new hampshire with senators like jeanne shaheen and maggie hassen who believe we need to work with nato and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state but a state that is a piece of the world we cannot be alone and that trade agreement was not perfect but the point of it is if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nations security in cokies memory let me answer this question we may have lost an election in  democrats but we did not lose hope and there is a way its actually based on a national academy of science report and ive used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in  years and eradicate it in a generation we can do it with investment in childcare we can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done but to get it done we have to be able to reach those voters that we lost in this state and across the country theres an old story of franklin delano roosevelt and when he died his body was put on a train and went up across america and there was a guy standing by those tracks along with so many americans and he had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and a reporter said sir did you know the president and the guy says no i didnt know the president but he knew me he knew me i will tell you this there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the white house right now i will bring that to you if you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent i know you and i will fight for you if you have trouble deciding if youre going to pay for your childcare or your longterm care i know you and i will fight for you if you have trouble figuring out if youre going to fill your refrigerator or fill your prescription drug i know you and i will fight for you i do not have the biggest name up on this stage i dont have the biggest bank account im not a political newcomer with no record but i have a record of fighting for people im asking you to join usamyklobucharcom im asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in america can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me please new hampshire i would love your vote and i would love the vote of america thank you thank you wolf and ive been very clear that i respect the mayors experience very much in the military i just have different experience ive been in the us senate for over  years and i think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions i will look at my position on the iraq war first i wasnt in the senate for that vote but i opposed that war from the very beginning in my first campaign for senate i ran against a republican who ran ads against me on it but i stood my ground when i got to the senate i pushed to bring our troops home then i have dealt with every issue from afghanistan to keeping our troops with good healthcare after what we saw with walter reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with their education and with their jobs and also with their healthcare i think right now what we should be talking about though wolfe is what is happening right now with donald trump donald trump is taking us pellmell toward another war we have a very important resolution we just found out today the four republicans are joining democrats to go to him and say you must have an authorization of military force if youre going to go to war with iran that is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the iranian nuclear agreement something i on for a significant period of time as president i will get us back into that agreement i will take an oath to protect and defend our constitution and i will mean it i would leave some troops there but not in the level that donald trump is taking us right now afghanistan i have long wanted to bring our troops home i would do that some would remain for counter terrorism and training in syria i would not have removed  troops from the border with turkey i think that was a mistake i think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to isis and then when it comes to iraq right now i would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by donald trump at the briefing we had last week i was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state and i asked them about imminent threat but i also ask them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague vague answers i asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if i was president and i asked them where they were going to leave the iraqi people time and time again you see that this president puts his own interest his private interests in front of our countries i would put our countrys interests first as commander in chief i would start negotiations again and i wont take that as a given given that our european partners are still trying to hold the agreement together my issue is that because of the actions of donald trump we are in a situation where they are now starting iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement so what i would do is negotiate i would bring people together just as president obama did years ago and i think that we can get this done but you have to have a president that sees this as a number one goal and an answer to the original question you asked the mayor i would not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon and then you have to get an agreement in place i think there are changes you can make to the agreement better sunsets and changes to the inspections but overall that is what we should do and i am the one person on this debate stage on the first night of the very first debate when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world i said china on the economy but i said iran because of donald trump because i feared that exactly what happened would happen enrichment of uranium escalation of tensions leaving frayed relations with our allies we can bring them back understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon brianne i want to hit reality here i serve on the agriculture committee and i will never forget going to crawfordsville here in iowa and thank you for bringing up iowa brianne since that is where we are i went to this plant and there was one worker left in that plant that plant had been shut down because of donald trumps trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard that worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms and he said these are my friends they dont work here anymore their names were embroidered on those uniforms derek mark salvador and that guy started to cry these are real people hurt by donald trumps trade war so what we should do and i support the usmca i am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like richard trumka and sherrod brown on labor and environment on pharma the sweetheart deal because i think we need a big trading block with north america to take on china the way you are stronger than china is with your allies thank you elizabeth i would like to … oh okay i thought it was such an open end i wasnt at the meeting so i cant comment but i was going to say … i hear that people have said it thats why ive addressed it from this stage i point out that you dont have to be the tallest person in the room james madison was five foot four you dont have to be the skinniest person in the room you dont have to be the loudest person you have to be competent when you look at the facts michigan has a woman governor right now and she beat a republican gretchen whitmer kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat kris kobach her name is … im very proud to know her and her name is governor kelly thank you third i would add to this you have to be competent to win and you have to know what youre doing when you look at what i have done i have won every race every place every time i have one in the reddest of districts i have won in the suburban areas in the rural areas i have brought people with me that is why i have the most endorsements of current iowa legislators and former iowa legislators in this race … … because i know i bring people with me finally every single person that i have beaten my republican opponents have gotten out of politics for good i think that sounds pretty good i think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the white house right now yeah senator sanders and i have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long long time and we agree on this but what i dont agree with is his position on healthcare this debate isnt real i was in vegas the other day and someone said dont put your chips on a number on the wheel that isnt even on the wheel thats the problem over two thirds of the democrats in the us senate are not on the bill that you and senator warren are on you have numerous governors that are democratic that dont support this you have numerous house members that put nancy pelosi in a speaker the answer is a nonprofit public option the answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health i have a plan for that and then finally what should we do about longterm care the elephant that doesnt even fit in this room we need to make it easier for people to get longterm care insurance we need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums my own dad i know when his longterm care insurance ends and then we have some savings for him hes in assisted living he got married three times whole nother story so there isnt much there but then we go to medicaid and ive already talked to catholic elder care theyre willing to take him in our story is better than so many other families we have to make it easier for longterm care its not just for senators its also for the sandwich generation … … people trying to help their parents again i think it is much better to build on the affordable care act and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream you have to show how youre going to pay for it i would also note practically that the affordable care act right now is ten points more popular than the president of the united states so i think the answer is to build on it and yes i think you should show how youre going to pay for things bernie i do this president is  people out theyre like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos the way he is adding to our debt i am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit i have shown how im going to pay for every single plan capital gains thats going to the personal level … … getting rid of the oil giveaways … … doing something about the hedge fund loophole you can go through and you can get the money to pay for things senator warren you acknowledged that medicare for all that you couldnt get there right away you got on the bill that said on page eight which is why i didnt get on it that you would kick  million americans off their current health insurance then a few months ago you said no youre going to wait a while to get there and i think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what were talking about is true and i dont buy that its not enough it is a big big step to say to people making  a year that your premiums will be cut in half which is what the nonprofit public option will do and if you talk mayor buttigieg about medicare and having negotiation i actually have led that bill for years i have  cosponsors as president i can get it done that would allow medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they cant negotiate for better prices for our seniors i will it done i am open to looking at it but i would try these things first number one i mentioned the medicare negotiation number two i have a plan  things ive found that a president can do herself in the first  days without congress that are legal and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries bernie and i had an amendment on this we got  republican votes on it it was at midnight they mightve not known what they were voting for but we got that i now have an actual bill with senator grassley that does that and i have a bill to get at what elizabeth was talking about which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market the issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of congress they think they own washington they dont own me and as president i will get this done no we have a constitutional duty to perform here and when i look at what the issue is its whether or not were going to be able to have witnesses weve asked for only four people as witnesses and if our republican colleagues wont allow those witnesses they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter they may as well make him king and last time i checked our country was founded on this idea that we didnt want to be ruled by a king and i think the best way to think about this trial and what were facing in this election is a story of a man from primghar iowa his name was joseph welch he came from humble beginnings a son of immigrants he became the army counsel and he was the one that went to the joseph mccarthy hearings and when mccarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs there was only one man everyone that was afraid theyre afraid of being blacklisted joseph welch he stood up and looked at mccarthy and said have you no sense of decency sir have you no sense of decency this is a decency check on our government this is a patriotism check not only is this trial that but also this election and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage i say this to  americans you know this is a decency check on this president well first of all i would note that i have a  rating from the league of conservation voters and that is because i have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration this trump administration trying to reverse environmental protections i think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasnt been raised by the way is the rules on methane which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on and i would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones when it comes to the issue of fracking i actually see natural gas as a transition fuel its a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by  to  to get to by  do a  reduction and i want to add one thing that no ones really answered when we do this we have to make sure that we make people whole and when we put a tax on carbon which we will do either through cap and trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon then we have to make sure the money goes back to the people that will be hurt by it  to help with their energy bills and to bring jobs to areas that will lose jobs our voters actually all americans have seen now a number of years of a guy that has i think told over  lies he is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric and i think what americans want is something different i am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in iowa the midwest is not flyover country for me i live here im going to be able to look at him and say youve treated these workers and farmers like poker chips for me these are my friends and these are my neighbors im going to be able to look at him and say you know what you got  million over the course of your career thats how you built your fortune and what im going to say is this my grandpa worked  feet underground in the iron ore mines saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two year community college thats my family trust and when you have been given an opportunity like that you go into the world not with the sense of entitlement donald trump but with a sense of obligation donald trump thinks this is all about him i think its about you its not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego it is about your healthcare it is about your schools it is about your lives and your future so if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her i have won every race every place every time i have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when ive led the ticket i have passed more bills as the lead democrat than anyone whos in congress thats running for president i believe that we need a president thats going to look out for you it is easy to hurl insults it is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day what is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth what is hard is the work of governing so if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me join me at amyklobucharcom let me make the case to the american people as a wise judge said the president is not king in america the law is king and what james madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention and by the way i think hes a pretty good size for a president he was five foot four and what he said he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution that the provisions are in there is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the american people for a foreign power that is what happened here watergate this is a global watergate in the case of watergate a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent he did it by getting people to break in this president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent and i would make this case as we face his trial in the senate if the president claims that he is so innocent then why doesnt he have all the presidents men testify richard nixon had his top people testify we should be hearing from mulvaney who is the one under oath witnesses have said that mulvaney is the one that said okay were going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent we should hear from bolden who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president that is the case if president trump thinks that he should not be impeached he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses i have a different view ill go with my friend sherrod brown who has voted against every trade agreement thats come in front of him and hes voting for this and i am too and the reason i am voting for it is that i believe that we have a change with this agreement i would not have voted for the agreement that president trump put forward but weve got better labor standards better environmental standards and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision which i also oppose  percent of our customers are outside of our borders and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair because if we can encourage work made in america every time you hold something in your hand that says made in america it is the ingenuity of our workers it is equality of a product it is equality of our workers and it is the hopes and dreams of the american people i think this agreement while senator sanders is correct there are some issues with it is much better than the one originally proposed and for those farmers in the midwest and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with mexico and with canada and the united states i think that this is a much better deal well i very much hope were not going to have to relocate entire cities but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents and the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in california with the fires that you just had you saw it in northern california as was mentioned with paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a  second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down we cannot wait to act theres an ojibwe saying that great leaders make decisions not for this generation but seven generations from now this president doesnt keep his decisions for seven minutes so what i think we need to do get back into the international climate change agreement i will do that on day one on day two bring back the clean power rules on day three the gas mileage standards i see the governor of california who has been working so hard to get those done defied every step of the way by the trump administration and then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards i wanted to add to what elizabeth said so the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes talking about whats happening on the coast is i just did but also talking about whats happening in the midwest where im from its not fly over country to me i live there and what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding were seeing an increase  increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills when you make the case like that you bring in the midwestern votes you win big and i think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket whos from the midwest id say this is america youre looking at it and we are not going to be able to succeed in the world if we do not invite everyone to be part of our economy our constitution says that we strive for a more perfect union well thats what we are in doing right now and to me that means one that everyone can vote and that includes our communities of color this action thats been taken by this president and his people and his governors all over the country is wrong they have made it harder for african americans to vote as one court said discriminated with surgical precision what would i do as one of the leaders on voting in the us senate one stop the purging as stacey abrams said you do not stop having your right to assemble if you dont go to a meeting for a year because you dont go to a church or synagogue or a mosque for three months you dont lose your right to worship you shouldnt lose your right to vote i would pass as president my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn  to vote that would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and i would stop the gerrymandering in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity because as martin luther king says what good is it to integrate a lunch counter if you cant afford a hamburger when it comes to foreign policy i think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats and this president has done neither and a country like china theyre leaders they watch that and they know he has stood with dictators over innocents he has stood with tyrants over free leaders he does it all the time and i have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with nato yeah they were making fun of him some of the foreign leaders ive heard senators make more fun of other senators than that the point of it was that he couldnt even tolerate it he is so thin skinned that he walked he quit america doesnt quit so if we want to send a message to the chinese we stand with our allies we stand with them firmly we have a very clear and coherent foreign policy when it comes to human rights check out my website amyklobucharcom i have the five rs of our foreign policy about reasserting our values rejoining international agreements like the iranian nuclear agreement but it all comes down to one r returning to sanity could i respond okay i just want to make very clear mayor that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart my dad was a newspaper man and i am the one that asked every attorney general candidate weve had under donald trump both of whom i opposed about their respect for the first amendment and they have refused to follow the rules that attorney general holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists they would not commit that they wouldnt put a journalist in jail for doing their job so this is not just talking points to me this is the real world and i think that experience that i will bring to the white house with protecting the first amendment is worth more than any talking points thank you for asking a woman this question first of all we have not had enough women in our government when i was on trevor noahs show once i explained how in the history of the senate there was something like  men and only  women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad they would shut it down however it is not just about numbers its about what you get done and that is my argument if you look at the poll at the state that knows me best and that is the state of minnesota it showed in the state that hillary had her lowest margin of victory it showed that i beat donald trump by  points i beat him with men more than anyone on this stage so i think what matters in this election is can you bring in those rural and suburban areas particularly in the midwest and number two what will you do when you get there and i am someone that has passed over  bills with men and women with republicans and with democrats including changing the sexual harassment laws for the united states congress a bill i led so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people i have passed the law for drug shortages i have done work in our rural areas i think thats what most matters to people i would be so proud to be the first woman president but mostly i want to be a president that gets things done and improves peoples lives i did not come here to listen to this argument i came here to make a case for progress and i have never even been to a wine cave ive been to the wind cave in south dakota which i suggest you go to so what is making a case for progress about that is what unites us up here instead of what divides us which is campaign finance reform that means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united it means making the first bill we pass when i am president will be  which is the ethics reform passed in the house which is currently sitting on mitch mcconnells desk along with  bills and if you dont think we can get this done well we can but only if we win this election big not by arguing with each other but by finding what united us in getting it done i came to make a case for progress can i address immigration reform thank you i started my day today with a group of immigrants who are there talking to me about housing and i thought about this president and what hes done he has used our immigrants as political pawns every single day he tries to draw a wedge i will be a different president my view on this comes from experience when i got to the senate senator kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package we got so close to passing that i voted for it not everyone did but most of the democrats did then i was on the judiciary committee when president obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform we actually passed that with republican votes then i was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the dreamers that would have solved that problem we didnt get that done because this president gutpunched us i will take my views i will take this experience i will get this done because immigrants dont diminish america they are america yes could i respond i was hearkening back… i made my case on immigration to what the mayor said about washington so i look at this a different way when we were in the last debate mayor you basically mocked the  years of experience on the stage and what do i see on this stage i see elizabeths work starting the consumer financial protection bureau and helping  million people i see the vice presidents work in getting a  billion for his cancer moonshot i see senator sanders work working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle and i see what ive done which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills so what you can dismiss committee hearings i think this experience works and i have not denigrated your experience as a local official i have been one i just think you should respect our experience when you look at how you evaluate someone who can get things done oh i dont think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the united states i certainly respect your military experience thats not what this is about this is about choosing a president and i know my view of this is i know you ran for to be chair of the democratic national committee thats not something that i wanted to do i want to be president of the united states and the point is we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate republicans and independents as well as a firedup democratic base and not just done at once i have done it three times i think winning matters i think a track record of getting things done matters and i also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us have a wider tent have a bigger coalition and yes longer coattails that matters if you had won in indiana that would be one thing you tried and you lost by  points could i answer the crisis  of course and i want to make it clear that ive opposed many many judges and i think everyone will remember what happened at the kavanaugh hearing when that nominee went after me i stood my ground and he had to apologize so i have been very strong on these judges as for the judge you just referred to there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a that went through the senate unanimously with support by senator sanders with support by president obama with support by then senator kennedy so i think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they arent but what would i do as president i would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like elena kagan and justice pryor and sonia sotomayor and lets not forget the notorious rbg thats what i would do and if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the judiciary committee look at the judges that i recommended to president obama people like mimi wright whos a superstar and susan richard nelson look at who i put in as the first openly gay marshall in the history of the united states i did that because i knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow but you also have to do it right away that is one thing that we all learn from when president obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these trump judges hard evidence to the contrary what do you say to that senator sanders you had your hand up senator sanders you do often point to your vote against the war in iraq is evidence of your judgment on foreign policy but you did vote for the war in afghanistan and as recently as  you said you supported a continued u s troop presence there was that support a mistake thank you senator mayor buttigieg you served in this war but i want to ask about your decision making if you were elected commander in chief you have pledged to withdrawal all us troops from a afghanistan within your first year as president but the taliban today control or contest more than half the country so should you as president still withdrawal all those u s troops if the country could once again become a haven for terrorists thank you mr mayor tim hey… okay thats true ill say this first of all bernie i promise when i am your president i will get our pharmaceutical bills done and we have worked together on this time and time again and i agree with you on that but where i disagree is i just dont think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas i think you can be progressive and practical at the same time that is why i favor a public option which is a nonprofit option to bring the cost down and yes it does bring the cost down immediately for  million people and then well expand coverage to  million people but heres the political problem this fight that you guys are having isnt real your fight bernie is not with me or with vice president biden it is with all those bunch of those new house members not everyone by any means that got elected in that last election in the democratic party it is with the new governor democratic governor of kentucky that wants to build on obamacare and the way i look at it if you want to cross a river over some trouble waters you build a bridge you dont blow one up and i think we should build on the affordable care act  well id ask for forgiveness anytime any of you get mad at me i can be blunt but i am doing this because i think it is so important to pick the right candidate here i do i think when you see whats going on around the country yes its the economic check that elizabeth and bernie have so well pointed out on this stage but theres something else going on here and it is a decency check it is a values check it is a patriotism check when you see people and weve all had this happen that come to our meetings and say yeah i voted for donald trump but i dont want to do it again because i want my kids to be able to watch the president on tv and not mute the tv we have to remember as democrats and if i get worked up about this its because i believe its so much in my heart that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out that is the gift we can give america in this election we have had quite a debate tonight but i want to debate donald trump this primary comes down to some simple questions who has the best ideas the best experience mostly who can beat donald trump and how will she do it so donald trump built his fortune on over time over  million that he got from his dad my grandpa he was an iron ore miner a union member who worked  feet underground and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a community college thats my family trust and i figure if you are given opportunity you dont go into the world with a sense of entitlement you go into it with a sense of obligation an obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself our politics right now because of donald trump are toxic we need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way so if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me if you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails join me we will win at amyklobucharcom i have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct and ive called for an impeachment proceeding i just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision but let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake this is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with ukraine but every step of the way puts his own private interests his own partisan interests his own political interests in front of our countrys interest and this is wrong this is a pattern with this man and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs leaving the kurds for slaughter sucking up to vladimir putin every minute of the day that is what this guy does and i think it is very very important that we have a president thats going to put our country first i was thinking about this when i was at the carter presidential museum and on the wall are etched the words of walter mondale when he looked back at their four years not perfect and he said this we told the truth we obey the law we kept the peace we told the truth we obeyed the law we kept the peace that is the minimum that we should expect in a president of the united states well im someone that doesnt come from money and i appreciate the work of mr steyer but right now we have a system thats not fair and its not just fair for money and so what i would do is start a constitutional amendment and pass it to overturn citizens united thats what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics i have led the way on voting and i can tell you right now one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn  if we had a system like this and we did something about gerrymandering and we stopped the voting purges and we did something significant about making sure we dont have money in politics from the outside stacey abrams would be governor of this state right now and thats what should have happened so while i appreciate his work i am someone that doesnt come from money i see my husband out there my first senate race i literally called everyone i knew and i set what is still an alltime senate record i raised  from exboyfriends and id like to point out it is not an expanding base so i dont just think this with my head i feel it in my heart first of all ive made very clear i think that pete is qualified to be up on this stage and i am honored to be standing next to him but what i said was true women are held to a higher standard otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president which we cant do because it has all been men and including all vice presidents being men and i think any working woman out there any woman thats at home knows exactly what i mean we have to work harder and thats a fact but i want to dispel one thing because for so long why has this been happening i dont think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president i dont think you have to be the skinniest person i dont think you have the loudest voice on the stage i dont think that means that you will be the one that should be precedent i think what matters is if youre smart if youre competent and if you get things done i am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead democrat in that gridlock of washington in congress on this stage i think youve got to win and i am the one mr vice president that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as the lead on a ticket every time i governed both with my head and my heart and if you think a woman cant beat donald trump nancy pelosi does it every single day i looked at this economically and i want to make sure of that we help people because its just pointed out we are way behind the curve our country is when it to providing paid family leave and childcare we must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big but what i had done with all of my plans is i have showed how im going to pay for them meticulously i think that is really really important when we have a president in the white house right now who have told over  lies so when you look at my website at amyklobucharcom you will see my plans and youre also going to see how im going to pay for it and i think that is so important because this president is literally increasing the debt treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day so yes my plan is three months i think thats good id love to do more as ive said before id love to staple free diplomas under peoples chairs i just am not going to go for things and this is not im not talking about senator harriss plan here but im talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here i am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car i think that we have an obligation we have an obligation as a party to be yes fiscally responsible yes think big but make sure we have peoples backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for and that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free which i dont support to kicking  million off their health insurance for health insurance in four years i just think we have to be smart about how we do this yes we need a new foreign policy in this country and that means renewing our relationships with our allies it means rejoining international agreement and it means reasserting our american values when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an american newspaper that sent a signal to all dictators across the world that that was okay and thats wrong and i want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said first of all the question about russia when we look at international agreements we must start negotiating back with russia which has been a horrible player on the international scene but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with russia and we must start negotiating even though they were cheating for the good of this world and we must also start the negotiations for the new start treaty and when it comes to china we need someone that sees the longterm like i do just like the chinese do because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet and they are in it for the long game well of course we should codify roe v wade into law that is what we should do this president indicated early on what he was going to do and hes done it when he was running for office he literally said women should go to jail then he dialed it back and said doctors should go to jail no surprise that were seeing these kinds of laws in georgia and alabama where his allies are passing these bills what we have to remember is that the people are with us i predict this will be a big election in issue in the general election i just cant wait to stand across from donald trump and say this to him you know what the people are with us over  of the people support roe v wade over  of the people support funding for planned parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need he is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of america this is how were going to win this election i just i want to … this i want to point out i agree with what the mayor has just said but this is a good example where he has said the right words but i actually have the experience and in leading  of the bills that are in that house passed bill you just referred to i think this kind of experience matters i have been devoted to this from the time that ive got to the senate i think having that experience knowing how you can get things done leading the bills to take the social media companies to task a bipartisan bill to say yeah you have to say where these ads come from and how theyre paid for and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have  states that dont have backup paper ballots that is my bipartisan bill and i am so close to getting it done the way i get it done is if im president just like i have won statewide and mayor i have all appreciation for your good work as a local official and you did not when you tried i also have actually done this work i think experience should matter the nation was riveted this week by the testimony in washington one of the people we heard from yesterday was lieutenant colonel vindman what he said was this he spoke to his immigrant father and he said in this country you can tell the truth and its going to be fine it reminded me of a army council years and years ago in the mccarthy hearing someone from iowa actually mr welch who said have you no sense of decency sir i want us to remember that this election is yes an economic check on this president i have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of healthcare yes this is also a patriotism check a value check a decency check when you look at the people that turned out in kentucky and turned out in virginia people turned out that didnt vote in  the african americans are turning out like we didnt see before but we also and they must be with us and we must get our fired up democratic base with us we also lets get those independents and moderate republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore this is how we build the coalition we dont just beat donald trump we bring the us senate to some sense we send mitch mcconnell packing this is how we win if you want to join us and remember that this wont be for me a personal victory itll be a national victory of someone that wins in red districts and suburban purple districts and bright blue districts every single time if you want to join us and if you believe that our work doesnt end on election day but begins on inauguration day join us amyklobucharcom thank you we can do two things at once thats our job we have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment but we also can stand up for america because this president has not been putting america in front of his own personal interests he has not been standing up for the workers of ohio hes not been standing up for the farmers in iowa and i take this even a step further you know when he made that call to the head of ukraine hes digging up dirt on an opponent thats illegal conduct thats what he was doing he didnt talk to them about the russian invasion he talked to him about that so im still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes america great again id like to hear from him about how leaving the kurds for slaughter our allies for slaughter where russia then steps in to protect them how that makes america great again and i would like to hear from him about how coddling up to vladimir putin makes america great again it doesnt make america great again it makes russia great again and that is what this president has done so whether it is workers issues whether it is farmers issue he has put his own private interests and i will not do that at least bernies being honest here and saying how hes going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and im sorry elizabeth but you have not said that and i think we owe it to the american people to tell them where were going to send the invoice i believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash obamacare but to do exactly what barack obama wanted to do from the beginning and thats have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies that is what we should be doing instead of kicking  million people off their insurance in four years and im tired of hearing whenever i say these things oh its republican talking points you are making republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan thats going to do that i think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and its the one we should get behind yes i do and i appreciate elizabeths work but again the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices but what really bothers me about this discussion which weve had so many times is that we dont talk about the things that im hearing about from regular americans that is longterm care we are seeing i once called it a silver tsunami the aging and then someone told me that was too negative so i call it the silver surge the aging of the population we need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen medicaid in this state the state of ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed those are the issues that i hear about when im in toledo  i want to give a reality it could work i am open to it but i want to give a reality check here to elizabeth because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires we just have different approaches your idea is not the only idea when i look at this i think about donald trump the guy that after that tax bill passed went to maralago got together with his cronies and said guess what you guys all got a lot richer that was the one time in his presidency he told the truth we have different ways i would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich including what he did with the corporate tax rate including what he did on international taxation you add it all up you got a lot of money that one helps pay for that childcare protects that dignity of work makes sure we have decent retirement and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools it is not one idea that rules here oh i would like to respond to that i think simply because you have different ideas doesnt mean youre fighting for regular people i wouldnt even be up on this stage if it wasnt for unions and the dignity of work if my grandpa didnt have unions protecting him in those mines he wouldnt have survived if my mom didnt have unions as a teacher she wouldnt have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating donald trump and taking this on… we are in ohio we can win ohio and the presidency but only if we unite if we unite around ideals and dont go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him amen we need to work with our allies to work with turkey and bring them out this is an outrageous thing that happened here and i think we need to talk about this a not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with turkey but the fact that our president blew it and now hes too proud to say it and what do we do now we continue that humanitarian aid but then we work with our allies to say come back turkey and stop this because what mayor pete has just said is true think about our other allies israel how do they feel right now donald trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the mideast think about our allies in europe when he pulls out of the iranian agreement and leaves them holding the bag and gives the power to china and russia think about the nuclear agreement with russia that he precipitously pulled out of this is part of a pattern its not an isolated incident marc i want to respond i want to respond to mr yang i dont see a moral equivalency between our country and russia vladimir putin is someone who has shot down planes over ukraine who has poisoned his opponent and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from russia invading our election this wasnt meddling thats what i do when i call my daughter on a saturday night and ask her what shes doing sorry this was much more serious than that this was actually invading our election so to protect ourselves in  what we need one backup paper ballots in every single state that is the bill that i need and we need to stop mitch mcconnell from stopping that from happening and then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads including ones last time in rubles without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them thats the honest ads act thats a bipartisan bill that i lead and we cant wait to become … president to get that done we need to get it done now correct i just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this im looking at the mayor of dayton i met one of those survivors from that shooting  seconds nine people killed the public is with us on this in a big way the majority of trump voters want to see universal background checks right now the majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation there are three bills right now on mitch mcconnells desk the background check bill my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers dont get guns the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun thats what we should be focusing on and i just dont want to screw this up when im president i do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and i do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in dayton ohio will never happen again but lets not mess this up with this fight well i want to thank her for this question this is something that should never have happened to begin with i remember when i was a prosecutor these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door and its gotten worse and worse and we now know why as the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits probably one of the most horrible things that i saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said keep pumping them out theyre eating them like doritos so my first answer to that question and which is included in my plan is that the people that should pay for this that should pay for the treatment are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place and that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids thats the first way you can with a  cents per milligram tax bring in the money plus with the federal master settlement to help in rural areas where theyre so isolated and also in urban areas where its by the way not just opioids there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues this is personal for me my dad he struggled with alcoholism his whole life and by his third dwi they said to him the prosecutor youve got to face jail or youve got to go to treatment he picked treatment and he was pursued by grace he has been sober ever since and now hes  and in assisted living he said to me last year its hard to get a drink around here anyway but he still has an aa group that visits him there and so for me i believe that everyone in this country including the people in rural america have that same right to be pursued by grace  i would like to have a different take on this i was in the private sector for  years represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market i had a life before government what i saw was when we got more competition there the prices went down in a big way in the longdistance market well right now we have another gilded age going on i am the lead democrat on the antitrust committee i have the lead legislation which means one changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what weve been talking about here is breaking down some of this consolidation also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because theyre so overwhelmed but the issue here is this start talking about this as a pro competition issue this used to be a republican and democratic issue because america our founding fathers actually wanted to have less consolidation we were a place of entrepreneurship we are seeing a startup slump in this country … and this means … everything from tech on down i would codify roe v wade and make it the law of the land but what i want to do right now is just say what if donald trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me you know what i would say to him id say you know you said you wanted to do this in your race for president you actually said that you wanted to put women in jail then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail that is exactly what the alabama law is it put doctors in jail for  years you donald trump are not on the side of women you are not on the side of people of this country when over  of people want to keep roe v wade on the book when over  of people want to make sure we have available contraception you defunded planned parenthood i would fund it again thank you this isnt a fly over part of the country to me the heartland is where i live i want to win those states that we lost last time i have bold ideas to get us there i think just because theyre different than elizabeths doesnt mean theyre bold but we cant get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win what i have done is win the only one up here time and time again the reddest of red districts michele bachmanns i won that district three times rural districts that border iowa and north and south dakota i do it by going not just where its comfortable but where its uncomfortable that is why i have been in pennsylvania and in michigan and in wisconsin and all over ohio and in iowa because i think we need to build a blue democratic wall around those states and … make donald trump pay for it for me its john mccain and i miss him every day i traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me hed say senator klobuchar is a lead democrat on this trip and she will go next and i still remember being there at his ranch john and i went to visit him and cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book because he could hardly talk and the word said this there is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself thats what were doing right now and while we have had major debates about policy we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us and we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy but to change the tone in our politics to look up from our phones to look at each other to start talking to each other because the way we win and not just win the presidency but take back the us senate is by winning big and the way we win big is with that fired up democratic base thats out there today but it is also about bringing in independence and moderate republicans i can lead this and i asked you to join me because ive done it before and i will do it again amyklobucharcom join our team thank you we are on a march together good evening texas southern i believe that what unites us up here the ten of us is much stronger than what divides us and i think thats true of our country too now i may not be the loudest person up here but i think weve already got that in the white house houston we have a problem we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show he would rather lie than lead i think we need something different i am someone that tells the truth i dont make promises that i cant keep i have peoples back and i believe that to win you bring people with you and that is how you govern as well youre going to hear a lot of ideas up here some will be great but if you see that some of them seem a little off track ive got a better way if you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense youve got a home with me because i dont want to be the president for half of america i want to be the president for all of america if i could respond george i think you know that i dont agree with some of these proposals up here george im talking about… if i could respond to some of the proposals but from my friends first of all senator sanders and i have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals that was a klobuchar sanders amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like canada we have worked to bring down the costs by fighting to allow  million seniors thats a bill i lead to negotiate for better prices under medicare i figure thats a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums i go with the doctors creed which is do no harm while bernie wrote the bill i read the bill on page eight on page eight of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it that means that  million americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance thats in four years i dont think thats a bold idea i think its a bad idea what i favor is something that what barack obama wanted to do from the very beginning and that is a public option a nonprofit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance cover  million more people and bring down the prices for  million more people that is a bold idea current health insurance yeah but a house divided cannot stand and that is not how were going to win this election thats not my record we are here at a historically black college and i think of an alum of that college barbara jordan and something she once said she said what the people want is simple they want a country as good as its promise and that same can be said of the criminal justice system so when i was there the way we handled these police shootings i actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them i took on our major police chief in minneapolis but in the prosecutors office they were handled with a grand jury thats how they were all handled across our state i now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself that aside i am proud of the work our staff did  people in our office the cases that came to us the africanamerican community that came to us they said there was no justice for their little kids there was a kid named byron philips that was shot on his front porch no one had bothered to figure out who did it when i came into that office we worked with the community groups we put up billboards we found the shooter and we put him in jail we did the same for the killer of a little girl named taisha edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window what changes did we make go after white collar crimes in a big way diversify the office in a big way work with the innocence project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness id and as a senator and as your president i will make sure that we dont just do the first step act when it comes to criminal sentencing that we move to the second step act which means the  of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails lets reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and lets get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison i so appreciate what the congressmans been doing and i want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us everyone up here favors an assault weapon pan everyone up here favors magazine limitations which by the way would have made a huge difference if that was in place in el paso in that store where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage and certainly in dayton ohio where in  seconds one man guns down innocent people the cops got there in one minute and it still wasnt enough to save those people thats what unites us you know what else unites us and ill tell you this what unites us is that right now on mitch mcconnells desk are three bills universal background checks closing the charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers dont get  its time to get something done and i personally think we should start with the voluntary buyback program thats what i think david but i want to finish this because if you want action now we got to send a message to mitch mcconnell we cant wait until one of us gets in the white house we have to pass those bills right now to get this done because we cannot spare another innocent life what weve got right now though george its not a focus tariff on steel what he has done here he has assessed these tariffs on our allies he has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos and if we are not careful he is going to bankrupt this country one forecast recently says that it has already cost us  jobs all right there is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the midwest in my state of minnesota and in iowa so what i think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table thats what i would do i wouldnt have put all these tariffs in place and i wouldnt have had a trade policy where on august  he announces hes going to have tariffs on  billion of goods on august  he cuts it in half a week later he says hes going to reduce taxes the day after that he says hes not going to do it the leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation and yes we want fair trade but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy which i think means enforcement like weve done in northern minnesota passing bills getting president obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit so we are importing exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things inventing things and exporting to the world he is defeating that goal thank you this is the existential crisis of our time you know that movie the day after tomorrow its today we have seen a warming in our world like never before were seeing flooding in the midwest flooding in houston fires in the west and i think having someone leading the ticket from the midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done on day one i will get us back into the international climate change agreement on day two i will bring back the clean power rules that president obama had worked on on day three i will bring back the gas mileage standards you can do all that without congress which is good on day four five and six i will working with congress and mayors and businesspeople all over the country introduce sweeping legislation to get at that  goal and on day seven youre supposed to rest but i wont this is what we need to do if were going to get at climate change we have to take this on as a crisis thats happening right now my challenges and resilience have brought me up here i grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life after his third dwi he had a choice between jail and treatment he chose treatment with his faith with his friends with our family in his words he was pursued by grace that made me interested in public service because i feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace then got married my husbands out there somewhere hopefully smiling and our daughter our daughter was born i had this expectation we were going to have this perfect perfect birth she was really sick and she couldnt swallow she was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half but when she was born they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in  hours she was in intensive care and i was kicked out i thought this could never happen to any other mom again so i went to the legislature our state legislator not an elected official a mom and i advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a  hour hospital stay when they tried to delay the implementation of that law i brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyist two to one when they said when should it take place they all raised their hand and said now that is what motivated me to go into public service when i got to that gridlock of washington dc and got to work and pass over a hundred bills … i know a lot of my friends here are from the left but remember i am from the middle of the country i believe if were going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit someones going to not just change the policies but change the tone in the country and someone who believes in america and believes it from their heart because of where they came from that everyone should have that same opportunity lets get real tonight we debate but ultimately we have to beat donald trump my background its a little different than his i stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man as the first woman elected to the us senate from the state of minnesota and a candidate for president of the united states thats because we come from a country of shared dreams and i have had it with the racist attacks i have had it with a president that says one thing on tv that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college youre going to hear a lot of promises up here but im going to tell you this yes i have bold ideas but they are grounded in reality and yes i will make some simple promises i can win this im from the midwest and i have won every race every place every time and i will govern with integrity the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation that is incorrect i just have a better way to do this and in one of my first debates jake i was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent and when she said it i said thank you so this is what i think we need to get done we need the public option thats what barack obama wanted and it would bring healthcare costs down for everyone and by the way i just dont buy this ive heard some of these candidates say that its somehow not moral to not have that public option well senator sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was bernie the medicaid public option bill that senator schatz introduced clearly this is the easiest way to move forward quickly and i want to get things done people cant wait ive got my friend nicole out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager and he died because he didnt have the enough money to pay for it and bernie and i have worked on pharmaceutical  together and we can get that expensive  i would say there is the will to change this in congress whats missing is the right person in the white house i believe that immigrants dont diminish america they are america and if you want to do something about border security you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those northern triangle countries then you pass the bill and what the bill will do is itll greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for help processing the cases and most of all it will allow for a path to citizenship because this is not just about the border donald trump wants to use these people as political pawns … when we have people all over our country that simply want to work and obey the law i disagree i disagree with his diagnosis of the problem yes this isnt just about a system or its not just about words this is about the nra i sat across from the president of the united states after parkland because ive been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the boyfriend loophole and i watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks the next day he goes and he meets with the nra and he folds as your president i will not fold i will make sure that we get universal background checks passed the assault weapon ban that we do something about magazines and that we understand when that little six year old boy died steven romero when his dad said hes only six years old all i can say is hes six years old we have to remember that yes what is broken is a political system that allows the nra and other large big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for the people are with us now after parkland those students just didnt march they talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said there must be a better way then we elected people in the house of representatives and guess what it changed and they passed universal background checks and now that bill is sitting on mitch mcconnells doorstep because of the money and the power of the nra as president i will take them on this is not about systems and words everyone wants to get elected but my point is this i think when we have a guy in the white house that has now told over  lies that we better be very straight forward with the american people and no do i think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of america off of their current insurance in four years no i dont think were going to do that i think there is a better way to get what we all want to see which is lower costs for healthcare do i think that were going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids no i dont think were going to do that so thats what im talking about but what i dont like about this argument right now what i dont like about it at all is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election and i think how we win in an election is to bring everyone with us and yes i have one in a state every single time statewide i have won those congressional districts that donald trump won by over  points he just targeted minnesota last week and ive done it by getting out there and talking to people by knowing rural issues and farm issues and bringing metro people with me in the state that had the highest voter turnout in the country thats what we want thank you dana and i was just in flint and they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous so my plan and i am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and i did that because this is a bread and butter issue its a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams i think the governor here in michigan smartly ran on the slogan fix the damn roads and it is an issue for union jobs and so i think what we need to do is not have a president thats promised he was going to do that on election night if anyone remembers and then he hasnt followed through he has done nothing he blew up a meeting at the white house i would put  trillion into this and i would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his maralago friends richer as he promised and i would take that money and put it into rural broadband and green infrastructure so you wont have what you just saw in detroit with the jefferson chalmers neighborhood the african neighborhood that was africanamerican neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms and i truly believe that if were going to move on infrastructure … and climate change you need a … voice from the heartland that you need a voice from the heartland well first of all there are people that voted for donald trump before that arent racist they just wanted a better shake in the economy and so i would appeal to them but i dont think anyone can justify what this president is doing little kids literally woke up this weekend turned on the tv and saw their president calling their city the town of baltimore nothing more than a home for rats and i can tell you as your president that will stop the second thing i would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country i know that because i have lived it and that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure theres a decent retirement system in place yes we help the africanamerican community and we must because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what weve seen in the last decades but we help everyone so what i say to the people in my rural parts of my state just like i say to them in the city and bring them together is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone i want to make it easier for kids to go to college and i think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most and my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids for wall street kids to go to college theres no difference it says everyone is free i dont think that makes sense and i am very concerned if we do things like that the debt were going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation so what i would do about student loan debt is that i would allow people to refinance it at a better rate and i would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them so that you literally over five  years can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we dont have enough workers i think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy … with our education policy i think we agree i just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place what i dont like is how this president has handled it youve heard of the truman doctrine the monroe doctrine hes done the go it alone doctrine with the rest of the world hes taken us out of the climate change agreement out of the iran nuclear agreement out of the russian nuclear agreement and i dont agree with that and when he was just with vladimir putin at the  when he was asked about invading our democracy he made a joke hundreds of thousands of americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote four little girls in birmingham alabama lost their life in a church at the heights … of the civil rights amendment so i do believe you meet with people but you better have an agenda and you better put our interests of our country first not the russians well thank you detroit to win we have to listen to people out there today is casey joes mom casey joe was a champion high school swimmer from a small town she got sick went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids the last thing that she said to her mom was momma its not my fault and she died a lot of americans say the same thing every day and that is what i will stand up for what i will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didnt tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen we need someone that has peoples back we also need someone that can win and i have won in these red districts i win in the midwest i can win in states like wisconsin and michigan and iowa i also will do my job without fear or favor just like i did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like ive done as a senator where ive passed over a hundred bills where ive been the lead democrat last yes i will govern with integrity we have the president where people turn off their tv when they see him not me i will make you proud as your president well first the economy we know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and donald trump just sits in the white house and gloats about whats going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums i do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids i do but i think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education my own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college theres many paths to success as well as certifications secondly id use pell grants id double them from  to  a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to  then the third thing i would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because i can tell you this if billionaires can pay off their yachts students should be able to pay off their student loans well i think its a bold approach its something that barack obama wanted to do when we were working on the affordable care act and that is a public option i am just simply concerned about kicking half of america off of their health insurance in four years which is exactly what this bill says let me go on beyond that theres a much bigger issue in addition to that and that is pharmaceuticals the president literally went on tv on fox and said that peoples heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices instead  drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office instead he gave  billion in giveaways to the pharma companies for the rest of us for the rest of america thats what we call at home all foam and no beer we got nothing out of it and so my proposal is to do something about pharma to take them on to allow negotiation under medicare to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries and pharma thinks they own washington well they dont own me i just want to say theres three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a womans right to choose so ill start with that then i just want to make very clear i think we share the goal of universal healthcare the idea i put out there the public option which the governor was just talking about this idea is that you use medicare or medicaid without any insurance companies involved you could do it either way the estimates are  million people would see a reduction in their premiums  more million people would get covered i think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal healthcare yes immigrants they do not diminish america they are america and i am happy to look at his proposal but i do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law what i really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that  of our fortune  companies are headed up by people that came from other countries  of our us nobel laureates were born in other countries we have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories we need them to start small businesses we need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants nd so my proposal is to look at that  bill that passed the senate with republican support to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible and get it done it brings the debt down by  billion it gives a path to citizenship for citizen… for people who can become citizens  and it wouldnt be so much better for our economy in america it was imperfect but it was a good deal for that moment i would have worked to get longer sunset periods and thats something we could negotiate to get back in the deal but the point is donald trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal those were his words and now we are a month away from the iranians who claim now that theyre going to blow the caps on enriching uranium and the iranians have told us this and so thats where we are right now he has made us less safe than we were when he became president so what i would do is negotiate us back into that agreement is stand with our allies and not give unlimited leverage to china and russia which is what he has done and then finally i would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict and were having this debate in congress right now that he comes to congress for an authorization of military force i would do that and this president is literally every single day  minutes away from going to war one tweet away from going to war and i dont think we should conduct foreign policy  in our bathrobe at five in the morning well thats not confiscation you would give them the offer to buy back their gun but ill say this i look at these proposals and i say does this hurt my uncle dick and his deer stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state these proposals dont do that when i was a prosecutor i supported the assault weapon ban when i was in the senate i saw those moms from sandy hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed and then now these parkland kids from florida they started literally a national shift you know why its just like with gay marriage when kids talk to their parents and their grandparents they say i dont understand why we cant put these sensible things in place they listen and if we get bested by a bunch of  year olds its the best thing thatll ever happen we need to get this done my life and my career and my work in the senate has been about economic opportunity and to me this means better childcare for everyone in this country and when you want to have an economy that works you need to have retirement that works you need to have public schools that work and you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future the stem jobs in fact donald trump one of the first bills that he signed of the  he signed where i was the lead democrat… okay thats a first up here… was one that was about that making sure minority community members could share in those jobs so to me this is about a few things its about an african american woman that goes to a hospital in new orleans says her hands are swollen and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies its about the fact that africanamerican women make  cents for every dollar a white man makes so in short we need to one… and i will do this in my first  days as president… we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table everyone can vote in this country and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform senator booker and i worked on that first step act but we should go to the second step act which is to help all our communities across our country two threats economic threat china but our major threat right now is whats going on in the mideast with iran if we dont get i wouldnt agree with what the congressman is saying but if we let the republicans run our election and if we do not do something about russian interference in the election and we let mitch mcconnell stop all the backup paper ballots then were not going to get what we want to do three things to know about me first i listen to people and thats how i get things done that is my focus i have a track record of passing over a hundred bills where im the lead democrat and that is because i listened and i acted and i think thats important in a president everything else just melts away secondly im someone that can win and beat donald trump i have won every place every race and every time i have won in the reddest of districts ones that donald trump won by over  points i can win in states like wisconsin and iowa and in michigan nd finally yeah i am not the establishment party candidate ive got respect but im not that person i am the one that doesnt have a political machine that doesnt come from money and i dont make all the promises that everyone up here makes but i can promise you this i am going to govern with integrity im going to have your back and im going to govern for you\n"
